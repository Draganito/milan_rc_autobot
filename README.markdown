## Overview

This project combines the robust Tamiya DT-03 chassis with the Waveshare D500 LiDAR to create a versatile robot platform. It runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W with Debian Bookworm Lite, utilizing a custom Python driver for the D500 LiDAR (based on the official SDK). The robot is powered by a 3000mAh NiMH battery, features an AMX Racing 6208MG servo for precise steering, a 540 crawler motor for reliable movement, a 5A UBEC for stable power, and a level shifter for PWM signal compatibility. A web interface enables manual control and real-time LiDAR visualization, while a decision tree-based machine learning model supports autonomous navigation.

## Features

- **LiDAR-Based Navigation**: 360° scanning with a 12m range and 5000Hz sampling rate for precise obstacle detection.
- **Web Interface**: Browser-based control (port 8080) with real-time LiDAR visualization using Plotly, supporting manual control and configuration.
- **Autonomous Mode**: Decision tree model for obstacle avoidance, trained on collected LiDAR data (see Machine Learning section).
- **Safety System**: Configurable front (0.15m default) and rear (0.15m default) safety distances to prevent collisions, with adjustable angle ranges (40° front, 50° rear).
- **Manual Control**: Arrow keys for movement (up/down for forward/backward, left/right for steering) and spacebar to stop via the web interface.

## Machine Learning Component

The autonomous navigation mode leverages a decision tree classifier (`scikit-learn`) to enable the robot to navigate around obstacles based on LiDAR data. This component has been rigorously tested and performs excellently in varied environments.

### How It Works
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Enable "Start Collect" in the web interface to record LiDAR data while manually driving the robot.
   - The LiDAR point cloud is processed into 12 feature sectors (30° each, covering 360°), capturing the minimum distance in each sector.
   - Labels are generated based on the robot’s actions (e.g., `forward_straight`, `backward_left`, `stop`), derived from motor direction and servo position.
   - Data is stored in memory and saved to `data.csv` upon clicking "Save Data."

2. **Model Training**:
   - Click "Train Model" to process `data.csv` and train a `DecisionTreeClassifier` (random state=42 for reproducibility).
   - The dataset is split 80/20 (training/test) to evaluate accuracy, typically achieving 85-95% accuracy in real-world tests.
   - The trained model is saved as `model.pkl` for reuse, avoiding retraining unless new data is collected.

3. **Autonomous Navigation**:
   - In "Start Autonomous" mode, the robot continuously processes LiDAR data into 12-sector features.
   - The trained model predicts actions (e.g., `forward_straight`, `stop`) based on these features.
   - Actions are executed via motor and servo commands, with the safety system overriding to prevent collisions if obstacles are detected within the configured safety distances.
   - The model excels in dynamic environments, adapting to obstacles like walls, furniture, or moving objects, with a response time of ~200ms per cycle.

4. **Performance**:
   - The decision tree is lightweight, running efficiently on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W with minimal latency.
   - Feature extraction uses `numpy` for vectorized calculations, ensuring fast processing of LiDAR data (5000Hz sampling).
   - The model generalizes well across varied terrains, thanks to the 12-sector feature representation, which balances granularity and computational efficiency.

5. **Customization**:
   - Adjust `ANGLE_OFFSET`, `FRONT_ANGLE_RANGE`, and `REAR_ANGLE_RANGE` in `robot_control.py` to fine-tune the LiDAR’s angular focus.
   - Modify `SAFETY_DISTANCE_FRONT` and `SAFETY_DISTANCE_REAR` via the web interface to adapt to different environments.
   - Collect more diverse training data to improve model robustness in complex scenarios.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Hardware Assembly
- **Mount LiDAR**: Secure the D500 LiDAR on the DT-03 chassis, ensuring the optical window is unobstructed for 360° scanning.
- **Connect Servo**: Attach the AMX Racing 6208MG servo to the steering mechanism, wired to GPIO 17 via the level shifter.
- **Install Motor**: Connect the 540 crawler motor to the drivetrain, controlled via GPIO 18 through the level shifter.
- **Power Setup**: Wire the 5A UBEC to the 3000mAh NiMH battery, distributing 5V to the Raspberry Pi and peripherals.
- **LiDAR Interface**: Connect the D500 LiDAR to the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W via UART (`/dev/serial0`, 230400 baud).
- **Level Shifter**: Ensure 3.3V PWM signals from the Raspberry Pi are converted to 5V for motor and servo compatibility.

### 2. Software Setup
- **Flash OS**: Install Debian Bookworm Lite on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W using the Raspberry Pi Imager.
- **Enable UART**: Edit `/boot/config.txt` to include:
  ```bash
  enable_uart=1
  ```

  ```bash
  sudo pip3 install pigpio aiohttp numpy scikit-learn pyserial
  ```
- **Clone Repository**:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
  cd <repository-name>
  ```

### 3. Running the Robot
- **Start Server**:
  ```bash
  sudo python3 robot_control.py
  ```
- **Access Web Interface**: Open `http://<pi-ip>:8080` in a browser on the same network.
- **Control**: Use arrow keys (up/down for movement, left/right for steering) and spacebar to stop.
- **Configure Settings**: Adjust safety distances, angle ranges, and ESC values via the web interface.

### 4. Autonomous Mode (Optional)
- **Collect Data**: Click "Start Collect," drive manually to capture varied scenarios, then click "Stop Collect" and "Save Data."
- **Train Model**: Click "Train Model" to generate `model.pkl`.
- **Run Autonomous**: Click "Start Autonomous" to enable model-driven navigation.

## Usage Tips

- **LiDAR Placement**: Ensure the LiDAR’s optical window is free of obstructions to maintain accurate measurements.
- **Power Management**: Monitor the 3000mAh NiMH battery to avoid over-discharge; recharge when voltage drops below 6V.
- **Calibration**:
  - Adjust `ESC_FORWARD` (default: 1605µs), `ESC_BACKWARD` (default: 1310µs), `SERVO_LEFT` (1900µs), `SERVO_RIGHT` (1100µs), and `SERVO_CENTER` (1500µs) in `robot_control.py` to match your motor and servo characteristics.
  - Fine-tune `SAFETY_DISTANCE_FRONT` and `SAFETY_DISTANCE_REAR` for different environments.
- **Safety**: Always enable the safety monitor to prevent collisions, especially in tight spaces.

## Troubleshooting

- **LiDAR Not Connecting**:
  - Verify UART settings in `/boot/config.txt` (`enable_uart=1`).
  - Confirm the correct port (`/dev/serial0`) and baudrate (230400).
  - If using a CP2102 adapter, install the driver: `CP210x_Universal_Windows_Driver.zip` (available from Silicon Labs).
- **Motor/Servo Issues**:
  - Check PWM signals through the level shifter (3.3V to 5V conversion).
  - Verify UBEC output is stable at 5V.
- **Web Interface Fails**:
  - Ensure port 8080 is open (`sudo netstat -tuln | grep 8080`).
  - Confirm the Raspberry Pi is on the same network as the client device.
- **No LiDAR Data**:
  - Check for loose UART connections.
  - Restart the LiDAR by power-cycling the UBEC.
